### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Dan, a self-taught Typescript engineer (slowly learning Rust ðŸ˜…) who cares too much about cross-platform applications and building things with serverless technology on the edge.

I've built software in advertising security, parking management, Wawa, a pharmaceutical company, my university, private individuals, and and I've taught others as a bootcamp teaching assistant.

If you're looking for my resume, see [my personal site](https://actuallydan.com) or my LinkedIn https://linkedin.com/in/actuallydan.
